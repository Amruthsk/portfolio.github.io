[head,branc,tag]-pointer

[HEAD] ↔ [*Branch Pointer] → [*Commit] ← [*Another Branch Pointer]

{movable}
[Branch]{move forward automatically in new commit}
[HEAD]{ current location in the commit graph. Most of the time, it points to a branch pointer}

{fixed}
[Tag]{permanent labels to a specific commit}

(git branch <name>)--->create new [branch],[head]@commited branch/previous branch

(git checkout <branch-or-commit>)---->moving [head] to new[branch]


(git merge <branch>)---->commit



HEAD <--> Branch
new commit - > [head,branch]- moves along same always

(Merge Conflict)-----> (push 1st, pull 2nd)---(waits human intervention)


(merge conflict)---->[repository]{conflicted}
(head/<-->/branch- different )---->[repository]{detached}



(git branch)@ scout-mission---->new[branch]

(branch @ [Current Commit]) ⇒ [New Pointer]

git branch scout-mission


(log) ⇒ (see @ [.git Repository]) → {Knowledge of Commit Graph}
HEAD -> main, scout-mission
two pointers (`main`, `scout-mission`) labeling the same commit hash

git log --oneline --decorate --graph


(checkout) ⇒ [HEAD] ↔ [scout-mission]
git checkout scout-mission


(log) ⇒ (see @ [.git Repository]) → {Knowledge of Commit Graph}HEAD -> pointing to new branch
git log --oneline --decorate --graph
