tree - text list -bom
Core Function - filenames


Content Reference - pointers sha1 hashes
A tree references content via blob hashes, it doesn't contain the content itself
[File]
|
(hash-object)
|
(Blob) + {SHA-1} -  independent objects within Git's database

[(.git/index)] - no change
|
(update-index---- git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 <HASH_OF_version.txt> version.txt)
|
(Blob) ↔ {SHA-1} ↔links - The change is internal to the Index [(.git/index)] - modified


Content Structure -  text list - type , hash, filename
 A tree is a new object with its own hash, and its content is a list of modes, types, hashes, and names.

[(.git/index)] - modified is read
|
('write-tree')
|
[tree] + {SHA-1} new tree within Git's database
|
(git cat-file -p <TREE_HASH>)
|
100644 blob <HASH_OF_spec.md> spec.md
100644 blob <HASH_OF_version.txt> version.txt


Immutability & Uniqueness sha-1 same for same file versions


Recursive Nature - nested trees
