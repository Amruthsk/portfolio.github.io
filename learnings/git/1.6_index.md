The working directory and the Index are separate. Initially, the Index is empty

Untracked files - 




A The Intermediary - between  working directory (your active files) and your commit history.

B (The Physical Substance) file located at
.git/index
C The Content - file permission,SHA-1 hash of the corresponding Blob Object,filename

The Index 
|
(file path and its structured entry via ls-files)
|
[is a physical manifest containing a file's metadata and content hash]  



D (The Gatekeeper )  - (git add) - blob object, and records that blob's hash in the Index
(git add)populates the Index (Claim D)

[File]

(hash-object)

(Blob) + {SHA-1} -  independent objects within Git's database

[(.git/index)] - no change

The same file, mission_brief.txt, is now listed under a new heading: "Changes to be committed.


E The Decoupling resulting in two different versions of the same file existing simultaneously

The Index is decoupled from the working directory 

(git status)
|
Changes to be committed" (The "Phase 1" version staged in the Index)

Changes not staged for commit" (The modified "Phase 2" version in the working directory)


F The Blueprint for Commits - git commit command does not look at the working directory. It builds the new commit exclusively from the state of the files as recorded in the Index

 git commit uses only the version of file in Index

 |
 (git commit)
 |
 Changes to be committed" section is now gone
 staged version of the file, not the working directory version
