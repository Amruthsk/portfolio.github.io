[commit] - tree hash,parent hash,author,commiter

a The Core Function - [commit] ↔ top level tree

b The Tree Pointer -tree objects exist independently and represent a directory structure
[file]
|
(git hash-object -w README.md)
|
(Blob) + {SHA-1} -  independent objects within Git's database
|
(git update-index --add README.md) - update index
|
[Index staging area]-(Blob) ↔ {SHA-1} ↔links 
|
(write-tree)
|
[tree] + {SHA-1} new tree within Git's database

a points to tree
d no Parent Pointer The Initial State  - nothing before
f metadata - author ,committer info  (name, email, timestamp)
g message - commit message
h Immutability & Identity - SHA-1 hash - which is calculated from its complete contents (tree pointer, parent pointer(s), author, committer, and message) - any change new object
[tree] + {SHA-1} new tree within Git's database
|
(commit)
|
[commit] + {SHA-1} new tree within Git's database
|
(git cat-file -p $COMMIT_HASH_1)
|
tree <hash_of_your_tree_object>
author Your Name <your.email@example.com> <timestamp> +<timezone>
committer Your Name <your.email@example.com> <timestamp> +<timezone>

Initial campaign launch.


c A commit object points to its parent(s), creating history.
[file]
|
(git hash-object -w README.md)
|
(Blob) + {SHA-1} -  independent objects within Git's database
|
(git update-index --add README.md) - update index
|
[Index staging area]-(Blob) ↔ {SHA-1} ↔links 
|
(write-tree)
|
[tree] + {SHA-1} new tree within Git's database
|
(commit)
|
[commit] + {SHA-1} new tree within Git's database
|
(git cat-file -p $COMMIT_HASH_2)
|
tree <hash_of_the_second_tree>
parent <hash_of_the_first_commit>/////Note
author Your Name <your.email@example.com> <timestamp> +<timezone>
committer Your Name <your.email@example.com> <timestamp> +<timezone>

Second phase begins.
