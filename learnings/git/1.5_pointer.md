pointer - file containing an address.
Branch
A (Physicality of Branches)-git/refs/heads/ directory.
B (The Content of a Pointer) for branch/tag -  40-character SHA-1 hash of the commit
--"A branch is a simple file in .git/refs/heads/ containing a commit hash."
[file]
|
('git add' & 'git commit)
|
[commit]
|
(cat .git/refs/heads/master)
|
Directly perceive the content of the master branch 'file' {SHA-1 hash} of commit

[The master branch]
|
(.git/refs/heads/master)
|
[file containing the {hash} of its latest commit]



HEAD
C (The Nature of HEAD) - current context or "location -  .git/HEAD
D (HEAD as a Symbolic Reference) indirect , ref: refs/heads/master
HEAD is a file at .git/HEAD that points symbolically to the current branch file."


The HEAD pointer
|
(cat .git/HEAD)->ref: refs/heads/master.
|
symbolic reference to the master branch, not a direct reference to a commit - path to another reference file, not a 40-character hash (Hetu


 E (Tags as Pointers) sotred as file .git/refs/tags/ directory.
 F (Two Species of Tags):
Lightweight Tags are also Pointer Files
A lightweight tag is a simple file in .git/refs/tags/ containing a commit hash.

git tag v1.0-lw()
|
[ A lightweight tag ] 
|
(cat .git/refs/tags/v1.0-lw)
|
display the exact same 40-character commit hash identical to a branchâ€”a direct pointer to a commit 

Annotated Tags are Full Objects

An annotated tag is a full Git object, and the reference file points to the tag object's hash, not the commit's

'-a' flag instructs the 'git tag'
git tag -a v1.0-an -m "Version 1.0 Annotated"
|
[annotated tag]
|
(cat .git/refs/tags/v1.0-an)
|
new and different 40-character SHA-1 hash of tag
points to an intermediate object, not directly to the commit 



REMOTE
A Nature of a Remote - bookmark - reference-  within a local repository that points to the URL of another repository.
B Content of a Remote - only name and url (origin)
A 'remote' is a named reference that stores a URL but is not the repository itself."


(git remote -v)
|
origin  https://github.com/Amruthsk/portfolio.github.io (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Amruthsk/portfolio.github.io (push)


C Physical Location - .git/refs/remotes/<name>/.
D Nature of Remote-Tracking Branches
A remote creates a namespace in .git/refs/remotes/ containing read-only pointers(main)

(ls .git/refs/remotes/origin/)
|
 Directory: D:\my_dev_space\portfolio.github.io\.git\refs\remotes\origin

 Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a----        28-06-2025     21:36             30 HEAD
-a----        17-08-2025     10:31             41 main







E The Update Karma
f Separation of Concerns

"git fetch updates remote-tracking branches but leaves local branches untouched."

(git log main --oneline
git log origin/main --oneline)
|
Before the fetch, the output of both git log commands will show the same single commit hash.
|
(git fetch)
|
The git fetch command will show output indicating it has received new objects
|
After the fetch, the git log main output will be unchanged. The git log origin/main output will now show the new commit ("Add new intelligence report") on top of the old one.
