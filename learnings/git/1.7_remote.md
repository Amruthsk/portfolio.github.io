 A (Nature of a Remote) pointer - named reference to the URL of another Git repository

 B (Default Remote) -clone -Git automatically creates a remote named origin â†” url u cloned
When you clone a repository, Git automatically creates a remote named origin

(git clone)
|
[new repo]
|
(git remote -v)
|
origin  https://github.com/Amruthsk/portfolio.github.io (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Amruthsk/portfolio.github.io (push)

{remote name & linked url}



  C (Multiple Remotes) -allowing it to interact with several other repositories
"A remote is a named reference" and "A single local repository can have multiple remotes."

(git remote add secondary-hq fake-url-for-demo)
|
(git remote -v)
|
{remote name & linked url} with new links
can manage multiple named pointers to other repositories



D (Fetching - The Reconnaissance Action) - downloads all the data from a remote repository that you do not yet have 
E (Remote-Tracking Branches)
git fetch downloads data without changing the working branch" and "creates read-only remote-tracking branches."

(git fetch origin)
|
(git branch -a)
|
Observe all branches, local and remote-tracking
The output of git branch -a will show your local main branch AND a new, red-colored remotes/origin/main

My local main branch  
|
(new commit exists only on the remotes/origin/main tracking branch, not my local one)
|
is unchanged by the fetch operation



F (Pulling - The Reinforcement Action) - git fetch & git merge
"git pull is a fetch followed by a merge.

(git pull origin main
git log --oneline --graph)
|
The terminal will show output indicating a "fast-forward" merge.


G (Pushing - The Publishing Action) - update remote
git push command transmits your local commits to a remote repository, 
git push transmits local commits to a remote repository."


(git push origin main)
|
indicating that objects were written and that the main branch on the remote was updated
