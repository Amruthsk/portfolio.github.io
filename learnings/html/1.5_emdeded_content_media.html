<!--  for <img> (The Image Substance)
 A (Core Function): The <img> element is a [] that embeds an image into the document.
 B (Essential {} - src): The src (source) attribute is a mandatory {} that contains the path or URL to the image to be displayed.
 C (Accessibility {} - alt): The alt (alternative text) attribute is a mandatory {} that provides a textual description of the image for accessibility (e.g., screen readers) or if the image fails to load.
 D (Inherent Form): The <img> element is an "empty" or "void" element, meaning it has no closing tag (</img>) and cannot contain child elements. Its existence is defined solely by its attributes.
 for <video> & <audio> (The Time-Based Media Substances)
 E (Core Function): The <video> and <audio> elements are [] that embed playable media (video and audio, respectively) into the document.
 F (Essential {} - src or <source>): The source of the media is specified either with a src attribute on the element itself or via one or more child <source> elements.
 G (Control {} - controls): The boolean controls attribute is a {} that, when present, causes the browser to supply its own user interface for controlling playback (e.g., play/pause buttons, volume). The absence (Abhāva) of this attribute results in no default controls being shown.
 H (Fallback Content): Unlike <img>, these are not void elements. The content between the opening (<video>) and closing (</video>) tags is treated as fallback content, displayed only by browsers that do not support the element. -->
