<!-- // Core  (The Nature of Inline): Inline elements are substances that do not interrupt the flow of text; they do not start on a new line.
//  A (<a>): The <a> element (or anchor element) creates a hyperlink to other web pages, files, locations within the same page, or email addresses.
//  B (<em>): The <em> element marks text that has stress emphasis. This affects the meaning of the sentence.
//  C (<strong>): The <strong> element indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency.
//  D (<code>): The <code> element displays a short fragment of computer code.
//  E (<span>): The <span> element is a generic inline container that, by itself, represents nothing. It is used to group elements for styling purposes (using class or id attributes).
//  F (<br>): The <br> element produces a line break in text. It is an empty element with no closing tag.
//  G (<sub> / <sup>): The <sub> element specifies inline text that should be displayed as subscript, and the <sup> element specifies superscript. Both have semantic meaning (e.g., in mathematical formulas or chemical notations).
//  H (<q>): The <q> element indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Browsers often add quotation marks.
//  I (<time>): The <time> element represents a specific period in time. Its datetime attribute allows for a machine-readable format of the date or time.
