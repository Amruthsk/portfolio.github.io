<!-- On the Document Declaration (<!DOCTYPE html>)
 A: <!DOCTYPE html> is not an HTML tag; it is a required declaration to the browser about the document type.
 B: This declaration must be the very first thing in the HTML document, before any other content.
 C: The primary purpose of <!DOCTYPE html> is to instruct the browser to render the page in "standards mode," preventing "quirks mode" which can cause unpredictable visual layouts.

 On the Root Substance (<html>)
 D: The <html> element is the root or top-level substance of an HTML document.
 E: All other elements, except for the <!DOCTYPE> declaration, must be descendants of the <html> element.
 F: A lang attribute is often added to the <html> tag to declare the primary language of the document's content for accessibility and search engines.

 On the Metadata Container (<head>)
 G: The <head> element is a substance that contains machine-readable metadata about the HTML document.
 H: The content within the <head> element is not displayed in the main browser window.
 I: Its primary purpose is to hold information such as the document's <title>, links to stylesheets (<link>), and metadata (<meta>) like character sets.

    On the Content Container (<body>)
 J: The <body> element is the substance that contains all the content of an HTML document that will be visibly displayed to the user.
 K: There can only be one <body> element in a document.
