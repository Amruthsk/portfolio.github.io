based on layout qualities - 2 types - block level elements - full width & new line & inline elements
- flow within the text same line
{Layout}
Block Elements (<p>, <div>, <h1>, <ul>...) are BOXES. They demand their own space and stack vertically.
Inline Elements (<span>, <a>, <strong>...) are HIGHLIGHTERS. They mark up text within an existing line without disrupting it.

Semantic Elements (<h1>, <ul>, <blockquote>...) have a BUILT-IN MEANING.


[HTML Element] { 1: Layout (Block | Inline)} + { 2: Meaning (Semantic | Generic)} 

Semantic elements
[p] → (I AM a paragraph)
 [<h1- h6>{ Block, Semantic-Rank-#}] → (To structure a document's outline with a level-# heading) 
[[p]{ Block, Semantic-Paragraph}] → (To group related sentences into a distinct, self-contained block of text)

[[ul] ⊃ [li]{Block, Semantic-Unordered-List }]   → (To group related items where sequence is irrelevant)
[[ol] ⊃ [li]{ Block, Semantic-Ordered-List}] → (To group related items where sequence is critical)
[[blockquote]{Block, Semantic-Quotation}] → (Display indented block content as a quotation, visually indented)

{Meaning}
Generic Elements (<div>, <span>) are EMPTY VESSELS.-the architect, give meaning to with id and class attributes. This is why they are so powerful.
generic containers
[div] + {class="article-card"} → (I WILL BECOME an article card)

[<div> { Block, Non-Semantic}] →  + (Semantic : Assign 'generic' role- Create a generic block-level box to group other elements)--(To create a structural "box" for grouping elements, awaiting purpose from CSS/JS)
