1) D
<!DOCTYPE html> - declaration for the browser - what version of HTML the document is written
type of rendering
standards mode 
<!DOCTYPE html> -> document.compatMode -> 'CSS1Compat'
renders the page according to modern web standards


quirks mode
<!DOCTYPE html> absent  -> document.compatMode -> ''BackCompat'


html - container  inside it has collapsable tree -tre of elements

2 main sub containers - head, body

inside which has elements -  can contain other elements or text.

text - contain raw strings


2)
Attributes - value for elements 

start of the element - name = value pair

id - unique identifier of each element 
class - categorize/classify elements or group multiple elements into one(can share)
Functional attributes  - href for a, src for image etc(specifically assigned)

in elements - add id,class,functional attributes - ----> can easily style , classify, make the element act to link and display




Semantics - gives HTML code meaning by using elements for their correct purpose not just for their default appearance.

Using generic elements  --> is meaningless to browsers, screen readers, and search engines.
like  <div> and <span> for everything

Using semantic elements ----> gives immediate built-in meaning and structure to the content 
like <nav>, <article>, <header>, and <footer>  



Semantic HTML ---->  critical foundation for easy accessibility
 as it allows assistive technologies (like screen readers for the visually impaired) to understand and navigate the page's structure.

 non semantic - uses div & class extensively
 semantic -  header,nav,main,articl,footer
 page seems the same -----> 
 semantic - -> clear ,meaningfull structure 
 Accessibility - tree structure

 non emantic - -> flat ,meaningless structure 
 Accessibility - abscence of tree structure
