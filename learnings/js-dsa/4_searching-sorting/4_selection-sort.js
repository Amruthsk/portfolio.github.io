// Selection Sort
// Learn the selection sort technique, where the smallest element is repeatedly moved to the front.


[7,1,5,4,3,2] n=6

-select min element and move it to first index by (comparing) &  swapping
- loop and put min element @ Front  [ sorted | unsorted]
- 

-1st full transvers ->(comparing) &  swapping
[1,7,5,4,3,2]

-2nd full transvers ->(comparing) &  swapping
[1,2,5,4,3,7]

-3rd full transvers ->(comparing) &  swapping
[1,2,3,4,5,7]

- 4th

- 5th

 n= 6  loop n-1

- iterate through the array 



for (let i=0; i < n-1;i++){
//assume the min as 1st element
min = i;

for(let j = i+1; j< n; j++){
    (){}
}

}
