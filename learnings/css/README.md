# HTML 

This repository documents my learning journey in **HTML**

### ðŸ“˜ What's Inside:
- Conceptual breakdowns of HTML elements (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, etc.)
- Practical examples with semantic tags, forms, media, tables, and structure
- Git-tracked mini projects for each major HTML concept

> This repo is part of my full-stack journey. Each folder and file is a reflection of core HTML principles turned into live, working code.
